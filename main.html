        <p align="justify">Pollution is a pressing global issue that encompasses the introduction of harmful or undesirable substances into the environment, causing adverse effects on living organisms, ecosystems, and the planet as a whole. It comes in various forms, including air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, and noise pollution. Human activities, such as industrial processes, transportation, agriculture, and improper waste disposal, are the primary drivers of pollution. The consequences of pollution are far-reaching, impacting both the environment and human health. It contributes to climate change, biodiversity loss, respiratory diseases, and contaminated water sources, among other problems. Addressing pollution requires a concerted effort through stricter regulations, sustainable practices, technological innovations, and public awareness to protect our planet and create a cleaner, healthier future.</p>
